            <p>
                    My Name is Matthew Madlang, but I go by Matt.
                I'm an average highschool student at the age of Seventeen(at the time of making this 7/7/2016).
                I like to think that my skill set for programming is rather large,
                however I know there is much for me that I need to learn.

                     My parents are divorced so my family is rather large. I have three sisters and one brother on my mom's side
                 and on my dad's side I have two brother. My sisters are nineteen ,four and one. My brothers are sixteen, fourteen and nine.
                 the ones that give the most problems are my two little sisters more specifically the older of the two(Avinlee). She can be quite a 
                 handfull and a bad listener she , along with my other sisters, is the best sister anyone could ask for. She can be hurtfull
                 and even if you know that she doesn't know better you can't stop the small sting when she says "I hate you" for not letting 
                 her do something. My oldest sister (Kirsten)lives in texas with her mom and doesn't talk to us much. As for the youngest of my sisters(Averee)...
                 well we have alittle longer to go before I can say much,But what I can say is that she is very well behaved when happy.

                My younger brothers are simple... they pretty much stay to themselves. The youngest one (Alex) finds farts funny and has uncontrolable luaghter.
                The middle brother(Jake) is rather quite and doesn't really like attention. The oldest of them all is  something of "long lost" borther.
                My Step-dad did know about him till about a year ago this summer, so I don't really know much about him. Like at all.
